# pyFarm
Automate farming test sensors and nutrient dosing via IoT

# Raspberry Pi
The utility used to implement everything

# Motivation
After a lot of research, I wanted to build something that provided more clarity, transparency, and cost effective approach to soil nutrition. There are lots of tutorials and talks mentioning to have your NPK correct, but what is correct? How do you know when you have it correct?

These scientists I learned an INCREDIBLE amount from and can't thank them enough for the free open-sourced information they shared in their decades of research. These guys are pioneers and rockstars in my book (and a lot of other ppl's book I'm sure).
